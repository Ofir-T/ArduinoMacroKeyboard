App notes:
- at the moment, the app will recognize your device only if you plug it in BEFORE starting the app.
- exectutables with multidevice in the name will allow you to choose between arduino COM devices. I havent tested it.
- also, the AMK will reset to it's default bindings upon device reset, but will retain the edited profile as long as it is powered. (will be taken care of in the future)
- application GUI was only tested on my laptop wih 1920x1080 resolution, so weridness might happen on other resolutions/aspect ratios.
