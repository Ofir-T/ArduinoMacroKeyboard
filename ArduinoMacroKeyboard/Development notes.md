- [ ] only hold in ram 1 keypad set. and re-load from memory every time set switcvh is executed
    - how to handle orientation? (maybe store always data in default orientation, and rotate when loading)
- [ ] remove padding strings/commands.
- [ ] protect against null command values.
- find start address of set: by terminator or by counting commands?
- start with fixed set sizes (because fragmentation), before going for dynamic memory management & fragmentation.
- ~~Setting useMemory to true crashes arduino. why??~~ Found it: problem with the pointers in keypadset not being initialized before being "replaced". the problem probably lies in the Command library.
- allReceived in NonBlockingSerial is default false, and set to false after every sent message. that prevent arduino from sending messages without receiving first.
- for now assuming encoded message isn't larger than max size of keypad byte-string.
- ~~something about the encoder becomes unstable after disconnecting from serial monitor. seems like after a few key presses it disappears. maybe something related to keyboard.release()? also, volume up/down triggers the DoubleClicked event for some reason.~~ was just a loose connector/bolt touching where it shouldn't. note to self: new board mount.
- longpressrepeat is weird as of now.
- byteArrayFromEeprom() depends on knowing set length in advance, but it is not always known in advance.
- change scan memory by X commands null-seperated sets?
- replace serial prints with nBSerial's
- implement debugToPc() and sendMessage() that can receive F()'d strings.
- [ ] confirmation messages => debugToPC()
- #pragma message(": warning<put what you like here>: blah blah blah")
- [ ] debugToPc debug levels
- [ ] boolean option to print device info to serial in setup
- [ ] use a different buffer than tmpBuffer for general stuff. it can mess up serial comm.
- keypadFromByteArray(tmpBuffer,...): set default to null pointer, and if so, read from eeprom instead.
- NBS buffers are not protected.
## Conversion to Command:
- [V] convert array rotation functions. now it's an array of pointers instead of numbers
- [V] deal with printArray(). maybe not necessary anymore?

## Last Task - Next Task
- [V] adapt gui to bindstr
- [V] adapt comms PC -> Arduino (save data)
- [V] resolve debug message on app close (maybe acknowledgement message? and stop using debug messages when not debugging)
- [V] add string input to gui bindings
- [ ] fix the gui bug introduced in the last commit, check amk['binding'] nested list situation
- [ ] rethink the acknoledgements
